# secure-password-generator

I have created a secure password generator which allows users to generate a unique secure password whilst meeting their criteria. For instance, the users are able to decide whether or not they want lowercase letters whilst still having uppercase letters and numbers and special characters. Consequnelty, they can specify what they want type of characters in the password.
